Encryption is an algorithm used to transform data in a way that only authorized parties can decode. It takes an input known as "Plain Text" and outputs a "Cipher Text" using an encryption key.

## Symmetric encryption

## Examples
One of the oldest examples of encryption is the Ceaser cipher which shifts each letter of the alphabet some amount. Then we get to more complicated encryptions such as character replacement where each character of the alphabet is replaced with another, or even more complicated algorithms such as the [Enigma](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine>).

Then there are modern encryption algorithms like
- [Advanced Encryption Standard](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>)
- [Data Encryption Standard](<https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES>)
- [Rivest Cipher 4](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4>)
