## Encryption
- What is encryption? (an algorithm used to transform data so that only authorized parties may be able to see it)
- What are the uses of encryption? (protect data from being stolen or changed)
- How does encryption protect the data? Why can't I just reverse the algorithm? (There is a use of a secret key that is known only by select parties)
- If I wanted to break a strong encryption, What would I need to do? (brute force the key)
- What are some examples of encryptions? Which one is the one we prefer using today? What reasons are there for it being strong? (AES, DES, RC4. AES is currently considered the standard, their strength comes from their key size and the amount of cycles)
- What is the disadvantage for to large a key size? What about the number of cycles? (slower)
- Why is the XOR cipher weak? (only one plaintext to break + you can guess parts of the key at a time)
- What are some real life scenarios where you use encryption? (Whatsapp, browsing, Ubbi dubbi)
- What types of encryption are there? (Symmetric, A-Symmetric)
- Compare symmetric and a-symmetric encryption
	- Keys used
	- Speed
	- Security
	- Key distribution
	- Uses (encrypt data in database or file, digital signatures)
	- Algorithms (RSA, ECC, AES, DES, RC4)
- How is symmetric encryption used with a-symmetric encryption? (agree on secret)
- What is bit strength?
- What mathematical principal does A-Symmetric encryption rely on? (integer factorization)
## Hash
- What is a hashing function? (fixed size output, deterministic)
- What are its uses? (password storage, data signature, checksum, key derivation, blockchains)
- What important properties does it have? (one way, collision resistant, uniform, avalanche)
- What are some examples of hashing algorithms? (SHA256, )
## Extra
- What is the zero trust approach?
- What is a zero knowledge proof?
- Quantum computers
